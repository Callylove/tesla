# Frontend Vue Developer Test

## Description

This project aims to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard using Vue.js, focusing on a report feature that showcases active users, topics, questions answered, accuracy, and more. The development process began by reviewing the design mockups in Figma to identify reusable components that could enhance maintainability and scalability. 

I explored various libraries for visualizing data in the form of charts and graphs, ultimately selecting those that best suited the project requirements. With a clear plan in place, I proceeded to design the components, ensuring a seamless user experience. 

The setup is built around Vue.js, leveraging its powerful ecosystem to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/Callylove/tesla.git
   cd tesla
2. **Install dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run**:
npm install
3. **Run the development server**:
npm run serve
This will start the local development server, and you can view the project in your browser at http://localhost:8080.
4. **Build for production (if needed)**:
npm run build
 
## Areas for Improvement
While the project is functional and meets the initial requirements, there are areas that could be enhanced:

1. Responsiveness: The current layout could benefit from further adjustments to improve the experience on various screen sizes. Implementing more flexible CSS and media queries would help ensure that the dashboard remains user-friendly on mobile and tablet devices.

2. Performance Optimization: As the data grows, implementing pagination or lazy loading for components could enhance performance.

3. Additional Features: Future iterations could explore user interactivity, such as sorting or filtering the leaderboard, to provide a more tailored user experience.
